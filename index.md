subtitle: Psycholinguist and Italian Sign Language interpreter

I am a psycholinguist and sign language interpreter specialised in sign languages and deafness.  

I am currently a PhD student in Linguistics and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Potsdam (Germany) and Macquarie University, Sydney (Australia) through the [IDEALAB PhD programme](https://phd-idealab.com/). In my research project, I investigate cross-situational learning of gestures in childhood and infancy using brain and behavioural measures. I am working under the joint supervision of Outi Tuomainen, Mridula Sharma, Natalie Boll-Avetisyan, and Amanda Saksida.

I came to academia after several years working as a freelance sign language interpreter and teacher for the deaf. As an interpreter, I specialized in interpreting in educational (universities) and artistic (museums, travel) settings. As a teacher, I worked in primary schools with deaf children with cochlear implants, using the bi-modal method to support their acquisition of spoken language and foster communication skills. 

I am now based in Berlin. You can often find me skating at Tempelhofer Feld while trying to make sense of things by listening to science and history podcasts.
