subtitle: Psycholinguist and Italian Sign Language interpreter

I am a psycholinguist specialising in gestural communication in hearing and hearing-impaired populations.

I am currently a PhD student in Linguistics and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Potsdam (Germany) and Macquarie University (Sydney, Australia) through the [IDEALAB PhD programme](https://phd-idealab.com/). I investigate cross-situational learning of gestures in childhood and infancy using brain and behavioural measures, under the joint supervision of [Outi Tuomainen](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ling/researchgroups/developmental-language-disorders), [Mridula Sharma](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/mridula-sharma), [Natalie Boll-Avetisyan](https://sites.google.com/site/bollavetisyan/), and [Amanda Saksida](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=BIJe21MAAAAJ&hl=de).

I came to academia after several years working as a freelance sign language interpreter and teacher for the deaf. As an interpreter, I specialized in conference interpreting in educational and artistic settings (university courses, guided tours, museums, and travels). As a teacher, I worked in primary schools with deaf children with cochlear implants, using the bi-modal method to support the acquisition of spoken language and foster communication skills. Since 2017, I have been collaborating with the [Baby Signs](www.babysignsitalia.com) group in Italy to promote research on the use of gestures in early infancy. In 2021, I obtained my first research scholarship at the Institute for Maternal and Child Health [IRCSS “Burlo Garofolo”](https://www.burlo.trieste.it/), Trieste (Italy).

I am now based in Berlin. You may often find me rollerblading in Tempelhofer Feld, trying to make sense of the world and things by listening to news, science, and history podcasts.
