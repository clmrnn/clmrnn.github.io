I am a psycholinguist specialising in sign languages and deafness.  

I am currently a PhD student in Linguistics and Cognitive Sciences at the University of Potsdam (Germany) and Macquarie University, Sydney (Australia) through the [IDEALAB PhD programme](https://phd-idealab.com/). In my research project, I investigate cross-situational learning of gestures in childhood and infancy using brain and behavioural measures. I am working under the joint supervision of [Outi Tuomainen](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ling/researchgroups/developmental-language-disorders), [Mridula Sharma](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/mridula-sharma), [Natalie Boll-Avetisyan](https://sites.google.com/site/bollavetisyan/), and [Amanda Saksida](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=BIJe21MAAAAJ&hl=de).

I came to academia after several years working as a freelance sign language interpreter and teacher for the deaf. As an interpreter, I specialized in educational (universities) and artistic (museums, travel) settings. As a teacher, I worked in primary schools with deaf children with cochlear implants, using the bi-modal method to support the acquisition of spoken language and foster communication skills. Since 2017 I have been collaborating with the Baby Signs group in Italy to promote research on the use of gestures in early childhood.

I am now based in Berlin. You may often find me skating in Tempelhofer Feld, trying to make sense of things by listening to science and history podcasts.
