subtitle: Psycholinguist and Italian Sign Language interpreter
---

I am a psycholinguist and sign language interpreter specialised in sign languages and deafness.  

I am currently a PhD student in Cognitive Sciences and Linguistics at the University of Potsdam (Germany) and Macquarie University, Sydney (Australia) through the [IDEALAB PhD programme](https://phd-idealab.com/), under the joint supervision of Outi Tuomainen, Mridula Sharma, Natalie Boll-Avetisyan and Amanda Saksida. My research interest focuses on investigating gesture learning in childhood and infancy using brain and behavioral measures. 

I came to academia after several years working as a freelance sign language interpreter and teacher for the deaf. As an interpreter, I primarily worked in education (universities) and art settings (museums, travels). As a teacher, I mostly worked in primary schools with deaf children with cochlear implants, using the bi-modal method to support their spoken language acquisition and foster communication skills. 

I am now based in Berlin, where you can often find me rollerblading at Tempelhofer feld.
